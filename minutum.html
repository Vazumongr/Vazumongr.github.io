    Minutum is a music based puzzle escape room game. As the player solves various puzzles and slowly pieces together the story, 
    the music also gets pieced together. I initially created it for a game jam hosted by some students at the college I was teaching at but based on
    peoples reactions and how much I actually liked it, I decided to continue developing it. You can download the game jam build of the project from
    <a href="https://vazumongr.itch.io/minutum">itch.io</a>

    I am developing the project on my own and all the assets, including music and 3D objects, are created by me with the exception of a few 
    textures used on objects like bookshelves.
    It is also the project that lead to the development
    of my <a href="waveformeditorextension">Waveform Editor Extension</a> plugin for Unreal.
