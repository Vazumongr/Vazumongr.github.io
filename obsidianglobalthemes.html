<p>
    Obsidian Global Themes is a plugin for the program Obsidian. It allows a central storage location for all your obsidian themes,
    no longer will you need to browse for themes, download theme, and apply them every time you make a new vault.
    If you're like me and like making new vaults for every project, that gets quite annoying. The plugin can be downloaded from the releases
    section on <a href="https://github.com/Vazumongr/Obsidian-Global-Themes">GitHub</a>.
