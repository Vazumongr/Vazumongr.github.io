    Welcome to Vazu's Cove
    </p>
</div>

<p>
I'm Vazumongr, often called Vazu for short, and this site serves as my personal "cove" of all miscellaneous creation-adjacent things. <strong>It is very much a work in progress, I just started making it September 16th.</strong> However, if you're a recruiter of some sort, I am in search of a full-time job as an engineer (preferably C++) at the moment so my <a href="workhistory">work history</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Vazumongr">GitHub</a> may be of interest. I can be contacted at <a href="mailto:vazumongr@gmail.com">vazumongr@gmail.com</a>.
</p>

<p> 
By trade, I'm a engineer that's been working primarily in Unreal Engine
for the last 5 years and have worked on 3 different titles as a bit of a generalist during my last job at NetherRealm Studios: 
Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, Mortal Kombat: Mobile, and an unnanounced project.
</p>

<p>
Outside of communing with the machine spirit to invoke the will of fun games, I also
like to dabble into music composition (I do play several instruments as well but don't record any of it (u_u') ),
art, UI/UX, and obviously game design like most of those in the industry. Snippets of which can be found on this very site!
</p>

<p>
You can find various pages related to Unreal in the tab conveniently labeled "Unreal Stuff". You'll find miscellanous projects such as modding projects or plugins for non-unreal things in the tab also conveniently labeled "Misc Projects". My naming schemes are unreal, I know.
