    Welcome to Vazu's Cove!
    </p>
</div>

<p>
I'm Vazumongr, often called Vazu for short, and this site serves as my personal "cove" of all miscellaneous creation-adjacent things. It is very much a work in progress.
</p>

<p> 
By trade, I'm a C++ Engineer that's been working in Unreal Engine 
for the last 5 years and have worked on 3 different titles as a bit of a generalist during my last job at NetherRealm Studios: 
Mortal Kombat: Onslaught (Shipped this one), Mortal Kombat: Mobile, and an unnanounced project.
</p>

<p>
Outside of communing with the machine spirit to invoke the will of fun games, I also
like to dabble into music composition (I do play several instruments as well but don't record any of it (u_u') ),
art, UI/UX, and obviously game design like most of those in the industry. Snippets of which can be find on this very site!
