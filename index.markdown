    Welcome to Vazu's Cove
    </p>
</div>

<p>
I'm Vazumongr, often called Vazu for short, and this site serves as my personal "cove" of all miscellaneous creation-adjacent things. <strong>It is very much a work in progress.</strong> However, if you're a recruiter of some sort, I am in search of a full-time job as an engineer (preferably C++) at the moment so my <a href="workhistory">work history</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Vazumongr">github</a> may be of interest.
</p>

<p> 
By trade, I'm a engineer that's been working in Unreal Engine primarily in C++
for the last 5 years and have worked on 3 different titles as a bit of a generalist during my last job at NetherRealm Studios: 
Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, Mortal Kombat: Mobile, and an unnanounced project.
</p>

<p>
Outside of communing with the machine spirit to invoke the will of fun games, I also
like to dabble into music composition (I do play several instruments as well but don't record any of it (u_u') ),
art, UI/UX, and obviously game design like most of those in the industry. Snippets of which can be found on this very site!
</p>

<p>
You can find various pages related to Unreal in some way in the tab conveniently labeled "Unreal Stuff". You'll find miscellanous projects such as modding projects in the tab also conveniently labeled "Misc Projects". My naming schemes are unreal, I know ;).
